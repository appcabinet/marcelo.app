I've always believed that I needed to become more independent. Younger Marcelo always dreamt of living on his own, buying his parents dinner, exploring the world, and living the kind of life an archetypal man-of-the-world would live.

For a while I had all those things — change however, happens slowly, and then suddenly. Before I knew it, this version of the world shattered and I was forced to lead a very different life. I was no longer independent; there were others I was responsible for, others I'd care for, others I would support. It was only after my relocation to Houston this past week that I've had time to reflect. In the words of young Marcelo, back in 2022:

I said this in a completely different context - yet it holds true.

One thing that's changed that I didn't expect is that I'm *less* independent now than I used to be. Not necessarily financially, but *emotionally.* The younger version of Marcelo was a tough kid. He thought that you had to go through things alone. He thought that strong men didn't show emotions, and would go on 6 hour walks to process them on his own. Perhaps an invisible patriarchy gave me those values. Perhaps they came from myself.
