import Aside from '../../components/note/Aside.astro'


This is my second time rewriting my personal site. My first attempt took an exorbitant amount of time and lacked in feeling; my second went far faster and looks better than I could have hoped for. It's satisfying to watch your sensibilities grow through enough dedication to your craft.

<Aside translateY={-100}>
To read about why I migrated off of substack, see [Why I Migrated Off of Substack](/notes/goodbye-substack).

I took to many different blogs for inspiration in the process of the redesign. Some of my favourites include [@kepano](https://stephango.com/), [@eugeneyan](https://eugeneyan.com/), and [@maximeheckel](https://maximeheckel.com/). I'll add some of my other inspirations down below for those who are curious.

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html) by Robert Nystrom
- [Openbook](https://openbook.so), my digital book project
- [37 Signals Libary](https://books.37signals.com/), built on [Writebook](https://once.com/writebook)
- [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com)
- [Hussam Zaghal](https://hussam.fyi)
- [Some Considerations about the Future of Reading](https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/7222/#BarthesEntretien1995)

<Aside>
I find it fascinating how design patterns emerge and evolve in digital spaces. Sites like these often share common DNA - clean typography, thoughtful whitespace, and a focus on readability. It's like watching *digital evolution* in action.

These choices aren't arbitrary - they're battle-tested approaches that have survived because they _work_.
</Aside>

The above gave me a flavour of what I wanted to build; something functional, simple, elegant. Coupled with my experience building Openbook, I decided I would build a site that felt like you were reading a book with a highly regimented, utilitarian aesthetic.

(aside:)
After dwelling for a while on whether I should stick to Substack or just write on my own site, I realized that my site was a digital expression of who I am. What are my tastes? My preferences? What tech-stack represents my values best? By delegating this identity through substack a part of me was last in translation.


### Technical Overview

This site is built on AstroJS and *no other framework dependencies*. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/appcabinet/marcelo.app).
